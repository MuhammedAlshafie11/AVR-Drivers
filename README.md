## Introduction

The GPIO Driver for Atmega16 simplifies the management of digital pins on the Atmega16 microcontroller. Whether you're toggling LEDs, reading button states, or interfacing with other digital devices, this driver provides an intuitive and efficient way to work with GPIO pins.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to start using the GPIO Driver for Atmega16 in your projects:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gpio-driver-atmega16.git
   ```

2. **Include the Driver Files**:

   Copy the `gpio.c` and `gpio.h` files into your Atmega16 project's source directory.

3. **Configure Your Build System**:

   Ensure that your build system includes the copied driver files during compilation. Consult your development environment's documentation for specifics.

4. **Include the Driver Header**:

   In your project's source code, include the driver's header file:

   ```c
   #include "gpio.h"
   ```

5. **Initialize the GPIO Pins**:

   Initialize the GPIO pins you want to work with using the provided `GPIO_Init` function.

6. **Use the GPIO Functions**:

   Utilize the driver's functions to set pin directions, read and write pin values, and manage pull-up resistors.

7. **Compile and Flash**:

   Build your project and flash it onto your Atmega16 microcontroller using your preferred toolchain.

## Usage

### Initialize GPIO Pins

Before using a GPIO pin, you should initialize it using the `GPIO_Init` function:

```c
GPIO_Init(Port, Pin, Direction);
```

- `Port`: The GPIO port (e.g., `GPIO_PORTA`, `GPIO_PORTB`) of the pin.
- `Pin`: The specific pin within the port (e.g., `GPIO_PIN0`, `GPIO_PIN7`).
- `Direction`: The desired direction of the pin (`GPIO_OUTPUT` or `GPIO_INPUT`).

### Set Pin Direction

You can change the direction of a pin (input or output) using the `GPIO_SetDirection` function:

```c
GPIO_SetupPintDirection(Port, Pin, Direction);
```

- `Port`: The GPIO port of the pin.
- `Pin`: The specific pin within the port.
- `Direction`: The desired direction of the pin (`GPIO_OUTPUT` or `GPIO_INPUT`).

### Write Pin Value

To write a logic high or low value to a pin, use the `GPIO_Write` function:

```c
GPIO_Write(Port, Pin, Value);
```

- `Port`: The GPIO port of the pin.
- `Pin`: The specific pin within the port.
- `Value`: The logic level to set (`GPIO_HIGH` or `GPIO_LOW`).

### Read Pin Value

To read the value of a pin, use the `GPIO_ReadPin` function:

```c
Value = GPIO_Read(Port, Pin);
```

### Read Port Value

To read the value of a pin, use the `GPIO_ReadPin` function:

```c
Value = GPIO_Read(Port, Pin);
`
- `Port`: The GPIO port of the pin.
- `Pin`: The specific pin within the port.
- `Value`: The logic level of the pin (`GPIO_HIGH` or `GPIO_LOW`).

Refer to the documentation in `gpio.h` for more details on function usage.
